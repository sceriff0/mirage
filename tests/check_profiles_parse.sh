# Profile parse guard
# ============================================================================
# Prevents the strict-parser regression that took CI down twice (see Phase 1
# of the hardening campaign): a committed profile must NEVER `includeConfig` a
# gitignored / possibly-missing file (e.g. conf/ieo.config). The latest
# Nextflow parser eagerly evaluates EVERY profile's includes at parse time, so
# one missing include breaks ALL profiles in CI and fresh clones.
#
# This guard temporarily removes conf/ieo.config (the gitignored site overlay)
# and asserts that every committed profile still parses (`nextflow config`
# exits 0). Run it in CI before the stub tests.
#
# Usage: tests/check_profiles_parse.sh [comma-separated-profiles]
# ============================================================================

# never moved, and it swallowed a FAILED `mv` at the same time -- which would
# leave the developer's conf/ieo.config sitting in /tmp with the guard reporting
# success. The `if` says the same thing and hides nothing.
